# Roblox-Link-Controller

A Roblox phishing link generator is a tool that cybercriminals use to trick Roblox users into revealing their login credentials. The generator works by creating a fake Roblox login page that looks identical to the real one. To make the generator work, Python is used to open SOCK5 sockets that connect to the local network and host a temporary website that contains the fake login page.
