# What is Roblox Link Controller?

RLC is a Roblox phishing link generator is a tool that cybercriminals use to trick Roblox users into revealing their login credentials. The generator works by creating a fake Roblox login page that looks identical to the real one. To make the generator work, Python is used to open SOCK5 sockets that connect to the local network and host a temporary website that contains the fake login page.

# Anti Virus Flagging Roblox Link Controller As Virus?

A program that connects to the internet and downloads all the necessary libraries needed to run an application may be flagged as a false positive by some antivirus software. This is because the behavior of downloading and executing files from the internet may be associated with malicious software or malware.

Antivirus software uses a variety of techniques to detect potential threats, such as signature-based detection and behavioral analysis. If the program's behavior matches that of known malware or suspicious software, it may be flagged as a false positive even though it is not actually harmful.

Another reason why a legitimate program may be flagged as a false positive is due to the use of obfuscation techniques. These techniques are often used by malware creators to disguise their code and evade detection by antivirus software. However, some legitimate software developers may also use obfuscation techniques to protect their intellectual property, which may trigger a false positive.

It is important for users to keep their antivirus software up-to-date and to use trusted sources when downloading software. Additionally, if a program is flagged as a false positive, users should investigate the issue further and report it to the software developer and antivirus vendor if necessary.

# What to do when having Issues connecting?

1. Check your hardware: Make sure that your modem, router, and computer are all plugged in and turned on. Check for any visible damage to cables or equipment, and ensure that everything is connected properly.

2. Restart your devices: Sometimes, restarting your modem, router, and computer can help resolve connection issues. Turn off each device, wait a few seconds, and then turn them back on. Start with the modem, then the router, and then the computer.

3. Check your network settings: Ensure that your computer is connected to the correct network and that your network settings are configured correctly. Check your IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

4. Run a diagnostic tool: Most operating systems have built-in diagnostic tools that can help identify and resolve network issues. Use these tools to check for connectivity problems.

5. Check for interference: If you are using a wireless connection, interference from other electronic devices or physical obstacles can cause connectivity issues. Try moving closer to the router or using a wired connection.

6. Contact your ISP: If none of the above steps resolves the issue, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for further assistance. They may need to send a technician to your location or perform further troubleshooting remotely.

# Controller Upgrades 

Controller upgrades are done by stopping the existing container gracefully (see the note below on this topic), removing the existing container, and running a new container with the new version of the controller. This can be done manually, with compose, or with manby other 3rd party tools which auto-update containers.

# Using Net=Host

In order to use the host's network namespace, you must first ensure that there are not any port conflicts. The docker run command is the same except for that all of the published ports should be removed and --net host should be added. Technically it will still work if you have the ports included, but Docker will just silently drop them. Here is a snippet of what the above should be modified to look like:


# Requirements
